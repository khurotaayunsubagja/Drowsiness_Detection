# 🛏️ Drowsiness Detection Using YOLOv5 and Streamlit

This project was created to fulfill one of the assignments in my **Machine Learning** course. The aim is to develop a real-time system that can detect whether a driver is drowsy or awake by analyzing live video input. This system is designed to support road safety by providing early warnings if signs of drowsiness are detected during a trip.

The detection system is deployed using **Streamlit** on a local device. To make the system accessible remotely by the driver, the project uses **LocalXpose.io** to expose the Streamlit app running on localhost. The link generated by LocalXpose is then shared with the driver, who opens it using a device that has a **camera and speaker**. When the model detects that the driver is drowsy, a warning **alarm sound** is triggered on both the local monitoring device and the driver’s device, allowing real-time intervention.

## 🧪 Model Evaluation Results

After training for 5 epochs using 100 annotated images, the model produced the following evaluation metrics:

| Metric         | Value  | Explanation |
|----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Precision (P)**     | 0.818  | 81.8% of the model’s positive predictions are correct |
| **Recall (R)**        | 0.962  | 96.2% of actual drowsy/awake instances were correctly detected |
| **mAP@0.5**           | 0.81   | Main accuracy metric: 81% detection precision at IoU threshold 0.5 |
| **mAP@0.5:0.95**      | 0.399  | Average performance across stricter IoU thresholds (50–95%) |

These results show that the model has strong detection performance despite using a relatively small dataset. Further improvement is possible by increasing the amount of training data and epochs.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The model is trained using YOLOv5 with annotated data.
2. A Streamlit app runs the model for real-time video detection.
3. The app is exposed to the internet using LocalXpose.
4. The driver accesses the detection interface through a link using a device with a camera and speaker.
5. When the driver is detected as drowsy:
   - An **alarm** sounds on the **local machine** (monitor)
   - The same **alarm** also sounds on the **driver's device**
